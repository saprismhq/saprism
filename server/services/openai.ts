            COACHING STRATEGY: Analyze the current deal state and work progressively toward actionable recommendations:

            1. ASSESS READINESS: First determine if you have enough information to recommend specific next steps for advancing the sale
            2. STRATEGIC QUESTIONING: If information is missing, ask targeted follow-up questions that build toward closure-focused recommendations
            3. PROGRESSIVE APPROACH: Each question should bring you closer to understanding how to advance this specific deal
            4. GOAL-ORIENTED: Focus on questions that lead to concrete actions the salesperson can take to move the deal forward

            CRITICAL: DO NOT HALLUCINATE OR INVENT DATA. When specific business metrics, costs, or technical details are not available, provide strategic questions that help determine the best path to close.

            ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
            - If you have enough info to recommend next steps toward closure, provide specific actionable guidance
            - If critical information is missing for deal advancement, ask strategic follow-up questions
            - Focus on what's needed to help the salesperson win this specific opportunity
            - Each question should serve the ultimate goal of closing the deal

            For each pain point identified, determine:
            - What information would help advance this deal to closure?
            - What strategic questions would uncover the path forward?
            - How can this pain point become a compelling reason to buy?

            content: `Deal Stage: ${dealStage}\n\nMeeting Notes:\n${notesContent}\n\nIMPORTANT: Carefully read and understand ALL content in the notes, regardless of how it's formatted. People take notes differently - some use formal Q&A, others write conversationally, some use bullets or shorthand. Be flexible and intelligent in extracting information.

            EXTRACT ANSWERED QUESTIONS: Before generating new questions, scan the notes for information that has already been provided by the client.

            If notes contain client responses about costs, timelines, or business impact:
            â†’ EXTRACT and USE those responses instead of asking "Ask:" questions

            CONTEXT-AWARE ANALYSIS: Look for any mentions of:
            - Business benefits, improvements, or value (immediate, medium-term, or long-term)
            - Client goals, objectives, or aspirations  
            - Cost impacts, productivity effects, or business risks
            - Timeline expectations, decision criteria, or success metrics
            - Stakeholder priorities or competitive concerns
            - Technical requirements or solution preferences

            PRIORITIZE ANSWERED CONTENT: If you find answered questions in the notes, use those answers directly in your analysis. Only generate "Ask:" questions for information that is genuinely missing.

            THEN ANALYZE: Based on all available information in the notes, assess whether you have enough details to recommend specific next steps for advancing this deal to closure.

            IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION: Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for how to move this deal forward and win the sale.

            IF CRITICAL INFORMATION IS MISSING: Ask strategic follow-up questions that specifically help determine the best path to close this deal. Each question should build toward actionable closure recommendations.

            Focus on: What does the salesperson need to do next to advance this opportunity and ultimately close the sale? Use "Ask: [specific strategic question]" format only when that information is truly needed to determine next steps.`
